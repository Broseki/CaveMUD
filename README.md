### What is CaveMUD?
CaveMUD is an old-school style Multi-User Dungeon text based fantasy game.

### Why is it called CaveMUD?
I don't really know. I just thought it sounded cool. The first text based game
that I played was DoorMUD and CaveMUD seemed about as logical for a name. I also
am a huge fan of RuneScape, and loved all of the caves you could explore (there
is a lot more than Caves in CaveMUD, but the name kinda stuck).

### What engine is CaveMUD based on?
CaveMUD uses a completely new engine, written from scratch in C++. It is based on an engine I wrote in high school in 2014-2015 (it has been completely re-written since then, but the idea came from that original engine).
It is designed to be super efficient and extensible, with multi-threading from day one.

### Current Progress
- [X] Networking base
- [X] Basic game loop
- [X] Logging system
- [ ] Telnet Protocol Support
- [ ] CaveScript (a scripting language for CaveMUD)
- [ ] UI Framework (Telnet UI)
- [ ] Character Creation
- [ ] Quest System
- [ ] Combat System
- [ ] Item System
- [ ] Skill Tree
- [ ] World Building Tools

(More will be added as I think of them)
